A deep learning-based web application for detecting skin cancer lesions using the HAM10000 dataset. 

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying 7 different types of skin lesions.

## Features

- Web-based interface for image upload

- Deep learning model with 90%+ accuracy

- Real-time prediction results

- Responsive UI with Bootstrap

- Confidence percentage display

- Support for multiple image formats
